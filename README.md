# My experience of driving in Italy with a PHEV

- All the required log files are located in the [logs](https://github.com/betizad/italy-trip-charging/tree/main/logs) folder.
- I have cached the geodecoding and routing results as json files in the [cache](https://github.com/betizad/italy-trip-charging/tree/main/cache) folder.
- The python code is saved in a [jupyter notbook](https://github.com/betizad/italy-trip-charging/tree/main/read_logs.ipynb) with the results. 
- You can see the interactive map with success/fail/note of charging points in the `output` folder: [folium Map](https://betizad.github.io/italy-trip-charging/output/index.html)
